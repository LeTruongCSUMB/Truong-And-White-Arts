THE LEGEND OF ZALDO
  This was the very first big new game and our midterm project for Game
Development that William White, Lewis Truong, and Neva Yeh worked on from
scratch. This game takes on a parody of the Nintendo classic, The Legend of
Zelda, specifically a Link To The Past with it’s orthographic art style.
Ironically this was made and completed before Lewis had any knowlegde about
Nintendo's upcoming new release The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening which is a 3D version of it’s predecessor. 

This game handles many quality controls that William and Lewis had problems occurring with their first games, Super Ballio, which was an overflow of code and mishandling of prefabs. TLoZ was handled with more care and was the fresh start of a different game genre after creating 2 platforming games in a row. Implementing different aspects of Unity that neither William, Lewis, and Neva, had touched before, including animation, enemy ai, and NPC dialogue.

The game’s afterword can be found at this link:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1adH9xUF0qLLJwjlqshIImGitfw3CpqRgNyBeqZMlT98/edit?usp=sharing
