METAL SPHERE: RIGID
   MSR is the first FPS shooter game that William and Lewis Truong both developed and worked on alongside with Roberto Bradley, Neva Yeh, and Dane Schwab, it is the largest and perhaps our most ambitious game ever developed and harbors many of what William and Lewis both feel were steps backwards in terms of intuitive gameplay and efficient file management. Due to the size of the team and the lack of communications from some other members of the party, there are numerous copied files that beef up the size of the game, and due to the intricacies of all these files it is nightmarish to even determine which files are of importance and which are not.

This project culminated in the earlier stages of Super Ballio Bros file management, something both William and Lewis thought they had already learned not to conduct. Overall the project was completed with less than what was originally planned,and continues our trend with working and implementing new features. Such features include raycasting weapons, weapon/tool pick ups, and a more advanced enemy AI with different states such as patrolling, searching, and chasing. In the future we hope to better communicate with larger groups of teams to better sort and manage the files of the game and reduce the scope of the project to its core concepts.
