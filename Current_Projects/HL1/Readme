HALF LIFE 1 GAME
  This is currently a new FPS shooter than Lewis Truong has been working on since September of 2019, it is basically a recreation of the Half Life series by Valve, that is currently being developmented as a side project for future prospects. It reuses some elements from its predecessor, Metal Sphere: Rigid, but has been compressed and upgraded to supplement more than before with less amount of code. It has also been the testbed for using Unity’s Physics, a callback Half Life 2’s physics, and a bit of an homage to William and Lewis’s first game being centered around 3D physics. SFXs are lifted straight from the actual Half Life games as neither William and Lewis are SFX artists, and some of the NPC sight scripts are from other resourceful programmers such as Sebastian Lague, particular from his github on Field of Visualization: https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=0nAJ5s90BEJqQg5bze4__G7woHZ8MTU3MDY1NzQ2OUAxNTcwNTcxMDY5&event=video_description&v=rQG9aUWarwE&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSebLague%2FField-of-View

Otherwise most of the scripts are written and appended entirely from scratch and will be continually worked on for the foreseeable future.
