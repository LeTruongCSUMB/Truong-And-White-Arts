BLAZESQUAD WILDFIRES
This is the submited Blazesquad Wildfires exe application, Created by William White, Lewis Truong and Mariano Pimentel 
for our Fall 2019 Advance Game Development final. It is a firefighting "simulator" which you must prevent the spread of
a forest fire by cutting down surrounding plants without cutting down the entire forest in the process.
